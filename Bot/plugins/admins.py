✘ Some people need to be publicly banned; spammers, annoyances, or just trolls.
Make it easy to promote and demote users with the admin module!
‣ /tban - Ban A User For Specific Time
‣ /warn - Warn A User
‣ /dwarn - Delete the replied message warning its sender
‣ /rmwarns - Remove All Warning of A User
‣ /warns - Show Warning Of A User
‣ /promote - Promote A Member
‣ /fullpromote - Promote A Member With All Rights
‣ /demote - Demote A Member
‣ /tmute - Mute A User For Specific Time
‣ /ban_ghosts - Ban Deleted Accounts
‣ /report | @admins | @admin - Report A Message To Admins.
➥ you promote or demote an admin manually, 
and innexia doesn't realise it immediately. This is because 
to avoid spamming telegram servers, admin status is cached locally.
